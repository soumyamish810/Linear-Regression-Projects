Project Title: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Objective Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices in the United States based on key features such as average income, house age, number of rooms, bedrooms, and area population. This project demonstrates how statistical modeling and machine learning can be used to extract meaningful insights and predict market behavior from real-world housing data.

Key Steps & Highlights:
Data Loading & Exploration: Loaded the USA_Housing.csv dataset and explored it using Pandas and Seaborn.

Visualizations: Used pair plots, histograms, and heatmaps to understand feature relationships and data distribution.

Feature Selection: Selected relevant numerical features that are most likely to impact housing prices.

Model Building: Applied Linear Regression using Scikit-learn to model the relationship between predictors and house prices.

Model Training & Testing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (67%-33%) to evaluate performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Visualization of Predictions: Plotted actual vs. predicted values and the residuals distribution to assess prediction accuracy.

Tools & Technologies:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Model Used: Linear Regression

Dataset: USA_Housing.csv

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
